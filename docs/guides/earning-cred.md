title: üíß Earning Cred
description: How you get Cred from your contributions.
---

As soon as you interact with SourceCred, you will be part of the Contribution Graph (i.e. a network of connected contributions). Being part of this graph is like having your own pond that holds [Cred]. Cred will flow in and out in different ways, just like water in a pond. 



### üíß Cred Minting
If community members find any of your contributions valuable, they **Mint**, or in other words, create, Cred, and flow it to you. This Cred just magically appears out of nowhere in your direction. If we compare Cred to water, minting Cred would be like rain - it would fall from the sky, new water collected in your pond!

The types of contributions and plugins are likely to increase. But for now, small is beautiful. Your contributions are tracked across the these active plugins in the following ways:


| üí¨ [Discord] | üßµ [Discourse] | ü¶† [Github]| ü•á [Initiatives]
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|someone gives your post : <img width="20" alt="SourceCred" src='https://sourcecred.io/img/favicon.png' /> or :100: or :+1:| someone gives your post/reply a :heart: | You open a pull request  | you accomplish a specific task approved by the community

### üî• Radiation
Since Cred can be created from nothing by community members, there must be a balance so that Cred maintains its worth. Our system is called **Cred Radiation**, and is similar to how water evaporates from all water sources. For every node on the Contribution Graph, a fixed proportion of its Cred radiates away, and that fixed proportion is called alpha.

### üèÑüèæ Cred Flowing
Every contributor gets a Cred score. Your Cred Score is the amount of Cred that is flowing *through* your pond - the amount entering is the same amount that is simultaneously leaving, flowing to other community members. Each of your contributions is interconnected with other community contributions across different platforms. Contributions are even connected through time - today's contributions connect to contributions from yesterday, last week, etc.

To put it differently, you are part of an environment that sustains itself across time where water is key. Water will flow in different ways. It will flow between contributor ponds (Cred Flowing), fall from the sky as rain (Cred Minting) and evaporate from everyone's ponds over time (Cred Radiation).

### üí° At a Conceptual Level 

When you react to a message with <img width="20" alt="SourceCred" src='https://sourcecred.io/img/favicon.png' /> in one of the plugins :

  - it creates a new reaction node in the graph, which mints Cred 
  - it creates an edge from the person reacting (you), to the reaction node
  - it creates an edge pointing from the reaction node to the message receiving the reaction
  
Minting new cred is also a change for the entire Contribution Graph. It will therefore induce a change on how Cred flows to others so as to keep everything in balance. Again, we need to make sure that water is circulating well with no congestions.
