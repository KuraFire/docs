Title: Founder

I'm a genderqueer dancer, a joyful hacker, and a bad philosopher. I've long been fascinated by the intersection of economics, philosophy, and technology, and SourceCred is an attempt to synthesize those perspectives into a tool to build new, more equitable ways of working together. I also love snowboarding and partner dancing.

SourceCred Branch/Job Description
Community Cultivation Lead & Documentation Lead

I'm a genderqueer artist and communicator. I got to be around for the conception of SourceCred, and later became a part of the team using my soft skills around interpersonal relationships and community structure. Now, I champion the Community Cultivation branch and work with our community to develop a wholehearted space that can scale with its values.
